Ecommerce site built with react, sass and bootstrap. This was my first project built with react and I used it to learn about hooks, context and react router navigation.

Main functionalities include:
- State management with hooks and context.
- Navigation with react router.
- Fully responsive design and styling done in SASS (Bootstrap was only used for some specific UI components).
- The user is able to see a list of products and search through them using different variables (brand, size, price, etc.).
- The user is able to see each product's detail and select the quantity and size he'd like to buy.
- The user is able to add products to a shopping cart or a wishlist, and also see other products recomendations.
- The user is able to check out and confirm the purchase after completing confirmation forms.
- Local persistance through local storage.
